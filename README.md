## 4. Summary

### a) Project Description

The idea is to create a stock trading bot that is able to buy and sell stocks using Deep Reinforcement Learning or RNNs. My goal is to be able to connect the bot to a broker via an API (e.g. https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en/developer). I want to experiment with different architectures and settle for the most promising one. The next step is then trying to find ways to improve the architecture or algorithmic details. Although predicting stock prices might prove to be challenging, I view it as a valuable learning experience.

### b) Dataset

The dataset will consist of past stock prices, most of which are public knowledge, with one possible dataset source being https://www.marketdata.app/.

### c) Work-Breakdown + Time Estimations

- Searching for the best online data source and setting the data up - 3 hours
- Searching for different stock trading algorithms and architectures mainly in the DRL and RNN sectors - 15 hours
- Experimenting with the found architectures and selecting the most promising one - 20 hours
- Trying to find ways to improve the algorithm/architecture - 20 hours
- Training and fine-tuning the network - 20 hours
- Building an application - 20 hours
- Writing the final report - 10 hours
- Preparing the presentation - 5 hours

Sum of estimation: 113 hours
